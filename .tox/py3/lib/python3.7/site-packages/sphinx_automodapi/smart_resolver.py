"""
The classes in the astropy docs are documented by their API location,
which is not necessarily where they are defined in the source.  This
causes a problem when certain automated features of the doc build,
such as the inheritance diagrams or the `Bases` list of a class
reference a class by its canonical location rather than its "user"
location.

In the `autodoc-process-docstring` event, a mapping from the actual
name to the API name is maintained.  Later, in the `missing-reference`
event, unresolved references are looked up in this dictionary and
corrected if possible.
