    ability to track locations of assets, detect duplicate uses of assets (when
    references and/or duplicate physical files) and more. Typically, the buidler
    will scan the list of documents to be processed for assets. When the
    translator is running, it will refer to the asset manager to know where an
    asset will be published (so the translator knows how to reference the
    asset). Finally, during the publishing phase, the list of tracked assets can
    be published to the respective publish points.
