Information on framework updates can be found on the teflo-watchers list. Updates will also be on the ci-infra-list.
If you have any questions, need help developing your scenarios, or how best to use teflo to fit your use case, we encourage
you to reach out to the teflo-watchers list as we have a diverse community of users that can offer insight on some of these
questions.

Logging Issues with Teflo
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, verify that the issue you are facing has not been logged, by
looking at unresolved `teflo issue
<https://projects.engineering.redhat.com/issues/?filter=-5&jql=project%20%3D%20CIDER%20AND%20component%20%3D%20Teflo%20AND%20resolution%20%3D%20Unresolved%20order%20by%20priority%20DESC%2Cupdated%20DESC>`_.

If the issue has not been logged, please log the issue using the following
options in `JIRA <https://projects.engineering.redhat.com/secure/CreateIssue!default.jspa>`_:

  * Project = CIDER(CID)
  * Component/s = Teflo

When filing the jira take a look out our `Support and Release policy <Support+and+Release+Policy>`__. It provides some help information on what information
to provide in the ticket and an SLA.
