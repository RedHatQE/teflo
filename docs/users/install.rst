==============

Requirements
++++++++++++

Your system requires the following packages to install teflo:

.. code-block:: bash

    # To install git using dnf package manager
    $ sudo dnf install -y git

    # To install git using yum package manager
    $ sudo yum install -y git

    # Install python pip: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing
    $ sudo curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
    $ sudo python get-pip.py

    # Recommend installation of virtualenv using pip
    $ sudo pip install virtualenv

.. note::

   To install Teflo pip version 18.1 or higher is required

Install
+++++++

Install teflo from source:

.. code-block:: bash

    # for ansible modules requiring selinux, you will need to enable system site packages
    $ virtualenv --system-site-packages teflo
    $ source teflo/bin/activate
    (teflo) $ pip install teflo

Post Install
++++++++++++

If you require teflo to interface with beaker using the bkr-client provisioner,
you will need to enable the beaker client repository/install the beaker-client package.
Teflo uses the beaker client package to provision physical machines in beaker.

.. code-block:: bash

    # https://beaker-project.org/download.html
    $ sudo curl -o /etc/yum.repos.d/bkr-client.repo \
    https://beaker-project.org/yum/beaker-client-<DISTRO>.repo

    # To install beaker-client using dnf package manager
    $ sudo dnf install -y beaker-client

    # To install beaker-client using yum package manager
    $ sudo yum install -y beaker-client

.. note::

    Beaker-client could be installed from PyPI rather than RPM. Installing from
    pip fails in Python 3. Beaker client is not compatible with Python 3
    currently. Once compatibile it can be installed with teflo. Teflo is Python 3 compatible.
