        Teflo is an orchestration software that controls the flow of a set of testing scenarios.
        It is a standalone tool that includes all aspects of the workflow.
        It allows users to provision machines, deploy software, execute tests against them and
        manage generated artifacts and report results.
        
        Teflo is developed in Python.
        It was originally known as Carbon.
